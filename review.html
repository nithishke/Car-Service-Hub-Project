    <h3>Salaar Story:</h3>
    <p>
        Deva (Prabhas) lives a casual life with a shadowy past along <br>
        with his mother in Tinsukia. The tranquility is disrupted when a group of goons <br> 
        searches for Aadhya (Shruti Haasan), newly arrived in town. Deva tracks the gang <br>
        and discovers it’s the scheme of his best friend Varadharaja Mannar (Prithviraj <br>
        Sukumaran) in Khansaar city. The war escalates, posing serious questions. Who is <br>
        Aadhya? What ties her to Varadharaj? What caused the enmity between the two best <br>
        friends? The movie unfolds the answers.
    </p>
    <h3>Verdict:</h3>
    <p>
        On the whole, Salaar: Part 1-Ceasefire stands out as an intense action drama that <br>
        features a terrific performance by <span>Prabhas</span>, especially in action parts, and <br>
        Prithviraj. The well-executed stunts contribute to the film’s overall appeal. <br>
        However, the simple narrative, a somewhat dragging second half, and excessive <br>
        violence are the notable drawbacks. If you are a fan of Prabhas or enjoy <br> 
        high-octane action-packed movies, <span>Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire</span> is worth a watch <br>
        this weekend.
